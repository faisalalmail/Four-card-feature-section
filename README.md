## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first actual imlementation of flexbox with `@media` query to create a responsive design that adapts to the screen size.

I would say it was challenging as it was new to me, but it wasnt so hard to figure out.
### Continued development

Toward more complex layouts we go
